# BrainNetSimulation
This repository is a framework for simulating a dynamical network using autoregressive moving average model.

The Users can define the number of nodes, the internal dynamics of the nodes and the connection between them and simulate time series that have that dynamics.
This toolbox can be used in conjunction with mrC.Simulate to generate realistic EEG signal with specific underlying network.

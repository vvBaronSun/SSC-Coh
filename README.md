# SSC-Coh
code for structured and sparse canonical coherence

Brain-muscle fusion has recently emerged as a crucial approach for probing multi-level communication between central and peripheral activities, typically relying on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for multivariate analysis. However, existing CCA-based fusion methods encounter challenges such as high dimensionality and limited sample sizes, thus restrict its further applications. In this paper, we propose a novel multivariate method, structured and sparse canonical coherence (SSC-Coh), to overcome these problems by incorporating structured and sparsity constraints for enhancing significant coherence and pattern recovery. The proposed SSC-Coh method establishes an optimization problem based on biological heuristics, enabling the combination of feature selection and model fitting. Experiments on simulation, healthy subject and stroke patient datasets reveal the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art methods, where our results achieve more significant canonical coherence and enhance pattern recovery. Furthermore, we also investigate the potential application of SSC-Coh in detecting biomarkers of stroke recovery. The algorithm revealed promising brain-muscle fusion features correlated with upper limb motor function of stroke patients. Our findings underscore the importance of structured and sparsity constraints in effective brain-muscle fusion analysis and highlight its potential applications in clinical practice.
